Hi, Iâ€™m Divya.  This is my personal portfolio repository. It includes projects and practice work using  HTML and CSS. I am a student who is passionate about learning programming and web technologies. The goal of this portfolio is to improve my skills, share my work, and gain practical experience through real projects.
